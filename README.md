vml-minification
================

This a simple boilerplate to use grunt to minify your projects.  The included 
project-src is the [boiled-down-plate](https://github.com/justinwehrman/boiled-down-plate).

To get started, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)(it has a one click installer).

After node is installed, open Terminal (or cmd in windows) and install grunt globally:  
`npm install -g grunt-cli`

Then install the plugins and dependancies outlined in ./package.json in Terminal: `npm install`

This will install the following:
Grunt 0.4.1, Grunt Contrib Modules: cssmin, concat, uglify, copy, clean, watch, stylus, coffee and jshint.
